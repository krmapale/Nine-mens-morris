# Nine men's morris - boardgame with C#, XAML and WPF.
The game is incomplete, but here are the features that work/are finished: 
- Board layout
- Adding buttons on the board
- Moving buttons
- Removing buttons
- Color changes for background, board and buttons (tools/settings)
- Changing the names of the players (tools/settings)
- "Info" and "about.." buttons in Help
- New game (resets the board)
- Print should work too. Atleast opens up print dialog
